# before you pip install pygobject, you need some system runtime dependencies

# I think these are the 2 core libraries you need:
# apt install libgirepository1.0-dev gir1.2-appindicator3-0.1 libcairo2-dev gir1.2-gtk-4.0

# here are a few others I installed while trying to get it to work; I don't _think_ they are needed:
# gobject-introspection-bin gir1.2-freedesktop-dev gir1.2-girepository-3.0-dev
# libgirepository1.0-dev libglib2.0-dev python-gi-dev

# and finally the actual Python packages
matplotlib
requests
pygobject==3.48.2
pyperclip
pillow
solar-angles>=0.26

# for testing
pytest
coverage
coveralls
flake8

# for polishing up the Pip install
PLAN-Tools>=0.5

# PyCharm will still likely complain about not being able to import stuff from pygobject
# This is because it is generating this dynamically at runtime from compiled libs
# You should be able to right click on the import error and say "generate stubs for ... Gtk" or whatever
# It will make an attempt at detecting all the library stubs, and the error should vanish
